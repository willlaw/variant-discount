# Variant Discount plugin for Craft CMS

Discount is limited to specific variant SKU&#39;s by searching the discount description field for the keyword &#39;ONLY&#39; and the variant&#39;s SKU. e.g. Discount ONLY applies to SKU78439 and SKU94300


## Installation

To install Variant Discount, follow these steps:

1. Download & unzip the file and place the `variantdiscount` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2.  -OR- do a `git clone ???` directly into your `craft/plugins` folder.  You can then update it with `git pull`
3.  -OR- install with Composer via `composer require /variantdiscount`
4. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins
5. The plugin folder should be named `variantdiscount` for Craft to see it.  GitHub recently started appending `-master` (the branch name) to the name of the folder for zip file downloads.

Variant Discount works on Craft 2.4.x and Craft 2.5.x.
